This task is for Ateet.

\subsection*{D\+E\+A\+D\+L\+I\+N\+ES}

First review\+: 29th December

Final deadline\+: 31st December

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 1}

Make a UI with 6 tabs
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Heave
\item Sway
\item Surge
\item Yaw
\item Pitch
\item Roll
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 2}

Each tab contains 3 or 4 sliders
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Kp
\item Ki
\item Kd
\item Setpoint (Not for pitch and roll) (heave and yaw setpoint -\/ integer, rest float)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Sliders should operate exactly like they do in the package thruster\+\_\+controller. Think how float values can be included in sliders.

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 3}

The Kp, Ki, Kd values for each parameter will be published on topics
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /sway\+\_\+params}
\item {\ttfamily /heave\+\_\+params}
\item and so on
\end{DoxyItemize}

The setpoints will be published together in the topic {\ttfamily /setpoints}

For the next two tasks, you may refer to {\ttfamily thruster\+\_\+controller} package\+:

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 4}

On startup, the node will read configuration from files in {\ttfamily config} folder. The file has order kp, ki, kd, setpoint for each parameter.

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 5}

There will be a save button which will save pid values and setpoints to the {\ttfamily config} folder again.

\subsubsection*{T\+A\+SK 6}

Understand what the {\ttfamily hammerhead} package does. Hint\+: it has been used in {\ttfamily thruster\+\_\+controller}

{\ttfamily \#include $<$\hyperlink{hammerhead_8h}{hammerhead/hammerhead.\+h}$>$}

For all tasks, ensure same file and variable naming convention that has been used in {\ttfamily thruster\+\_\+controller} package. Also ensure same folder organization for include folder.
