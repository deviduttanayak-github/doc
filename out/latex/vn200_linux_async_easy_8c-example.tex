This example shows how to retrieve the lastest asynchronous data packet received from the V\+N-\/200 sensor by using the function \hyperlink{vn200_8h_a2060fcad0e15c7c457f2918610c6b477}{vn200\+\_\+get\+Current\+Async\+Data}. This function is useful since it does not block while a command transaction is performed with the sensor. The library\textquotesingle{}s backend thread is constantly servicing the C\+OM port and when asychronous data is received from the sensor, it saves a copy in memory making it immediately accessible on the call to \hyperlink{vn200_8h_a2060fcad0e15c7c457f2918610c6b477}{vn200\+\_\+get\+Current\+Async\+Data}.
