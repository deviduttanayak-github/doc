\hypertarget{vn100_windows_dynamic_dll_8c-example}{}\section{vn100\+\_\+windows\+\_\+dynamic\+\_\+dll.\+c}
This example is a conversion of the \hyperlink{vn100_windows_basic_8c-example}{vn100\+\_\+windows\+\_\+basic.c} so that it uses a dynamically loaded D\+LL provided by the library. The Windows A\+PI is used via the {\ttfamily windows.\+h} header file to load the D\+LL into memory using the function {\ttfamily Load\+Library} and then pointers to the functions provided by the D\+LL are retrieved individually using the function {\ttfamily Get\+Proc\+Address}.
